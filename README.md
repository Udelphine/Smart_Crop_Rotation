# 1. Introduction

Agriculture remains a critical sector in many developing nations, especially for smallholder farmers who rely heavily on soil fertility and seasonal crop cycles. Poor planning of crop rotation often results in soil nutrient depletion, pest proliferation, and reduced yields. To address these challenges, this project introduces the **Smart Crop Rotation Management System**, a decision-support platform designed to recommend optimal crop rotation sequences using scientifically grounded algorithms.

The system integrates software engineering best practices, clean code principles, the Strategy Design Pattern, UML modelling, testing methodologies, and containerized deployment. It demonstrates an end-to-end development workflow appropriate for academic evaluation and real-world application.
